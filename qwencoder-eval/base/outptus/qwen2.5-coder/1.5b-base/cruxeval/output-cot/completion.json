The function enters a while loop that continues as long as search_string is found in text.\n4. Inside the loop, the function uses the rindex method to find the last occurrence of search_string in text, and appends the index to the indexes list.\n5. The function then updates text by slicing it from the beginning to the index found in step 4, effectively removing the found substring from text.\n6. The while loop continues until search_string is no longer found in text.\n7. The function returns the indexes list.\n8.

        "Let's execute the code step by step:\n\n1. The function f is defined, which takes two arguments s and ch.\n2. The function is called with the arguments 'shivajimonto6' and '6', so within the function, s is initially 'shivajimonto6' and ch is '6'.\n3. Inside the function, the function checks if '6' is in s. Since it is, the function proceeds to partition s at the first occurrence of '6', resulting in a tuple ('shiva', 'jimonto6', '').\n4. The function then reverses the second part of the tuple (which is 'jimonto6'), resulting in '6tmonij'.\n5. The function then iterates over the reversed string, reversing it again each time, resulting in '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6tmonij' -> 'jimonto6' -> '6t"
