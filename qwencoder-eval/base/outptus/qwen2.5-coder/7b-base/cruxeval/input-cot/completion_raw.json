It returns a string that is the result of applying the function to the input.\n\nThe function first checks if symbols is not empty. If it is not empty, it counts the number of symbols and multiplies the text by that count. Then, it right-justifies the text by adding spaces to the left until the length of the text is equal to the length of the text plus the count of symbols multiplied by 2. Finally, it removes the last two characters from the text.\n\nTo get the output '        ', we need to find an input where the text is empty and the symbols are not empty. The count of symbols should be 8, and the text should be multiplied by 8.

We know that f(??) == 't\\nZA\\nA'. \n\nThe function f(text, ch) takes two arguments: text and ch. It splits the text into lines and checks if the first character of each line is equal to ch. If it is, it converts the line to lowercase and appends it to the result list. Otherwise, it converts the line to uppercase and appends it to the result list. Finally, it joins the result list into a single string with newline characters.\n\nTo achieve the given output, we need to find a text and a ch value that satisfy the conditions mentioned above. \n\nLet's start with the ch value. The first line of the output is 't', which is lowercase. This means that the first character of the first line in the input text should be 't'. \n\nNow, let's consider the second line of the output, 'ZA'. This line is in uppercase, which means that the first character of the second line in the input text should not be 't'. \n\nFinally, let's look at the third line of the output, 'A'. This line is also in uppercase, which means that the first character of the third line in the input text should not be 't'. \n\nBased on these observations, we can construct a text that satisfies the conditions. Here's an example:\n\ntext = 't\\nZ\\nA'\nch = 't'\n\nWhen we execute f(text, ch), it will split the text into lines and check the first character of each line. The first line starts with 't', so it will be converted to lowercase and appended to the result list. The second line starts with 'Z', so it will be converted to uppercase and appended to the result list.

The function f takes three parameters: text, substr, and occ. It searches for the last occurrence of substr in text and returns its index. If the occurrence number (occ) is reached, it returns the index of that occurrence. If the substring is not found or the occurrence number is not reached, it returns -1.\n\nTo make f return -1, we need to ensure that the substring is not found in the text or that the occurrence number is not reached. One way to achieve this is by providing a text that does not contain the substring or by providing a substring that is not present in the text.\n\nLet's consider the following input:\ntext = \"Hello, world!\"\nsubstr = \"Python\"\nocc = 1\n\nIn this case, the substring \"Python\" is not present in the text \"Hello, world!\", so the function f will return -1.\n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nassert f(\"Hello, world!\", \"Python\", 1) == -1\n"

If it is, it returns 'imbalanced'. Otherwise, it returns a concatenated with b, where all occurrences of sep are replaced with an empty string. \n\nTo get the output 'fubarbaz', we need to find a string t such that when it is partitioned, the length of b is not equal to the length of a, and when the occurrences of sep are replaced with an empty string, the result is 'fubarbaz'. \n\nOne possible input that satisfies these conditions is 'fubar-baz'. When this string is partitioned, a is 'fubar', sep is '-', and b is 'baz'. The length of b is not equal to the length of a, so the function does not return 'imbalanced'.

We know that f(??) == '1 '.\n\nThe function f(n) takes an integer n and returns a string. The string is constructed by iterating over the digits of n and adding a string of spaces to the streak variable. The number of spaces added is equal to the digit multiplied by 2.\n\nTo get the output '1 ', we need to find an input n such that the first digit of n is 1 and the rest of the digits are 0. This is because the function will only add spaces to the streak variable for the first digit, and the rest of the digits will be ignored.\n\nTherefore, the input n should be 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
