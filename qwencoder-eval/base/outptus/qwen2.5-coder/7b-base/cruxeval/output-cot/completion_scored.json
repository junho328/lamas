The function is called with the arguments 'DSUWeqExTQdCMGpqur', 'a', and 'x'.\n3. Inside the function, count is initialized to 0.\n4. new_text is initialized as an empty list.\n5. The for loop iterates over each character in the text 'DSUWeqExTQdCMGpqur'.\n6. For each character, if it is a decimal digit, it is replaced with the value of lower ('a'), otherwise it is replaced with the value of upper ('x').\n7.

The function is called with the argument \"x--y-z-5-C\", so within the function, text is initially \"x--y-z-5-C\".\n3. The text is modified by replacing all occurrences of '-' with an empty string, resulting in \"xy-z5C\".\n4. The text is then converted to lowercase, resulting in \"xy-z5c\".\n5.
